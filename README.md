## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)

## My process

### Built with

- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS bundler
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) - Database
- [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/api) - API
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Hosting
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) - CLI
- [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction) - Serverless functions
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Finally had the opportunity to interact with an external API and create my own serverless functions! This challenge was amazing as it allowed me to finally use fetch and create backend code in the form of Vercel serverless functions.

### Continued development

I want to continue using serverless functions and APIs to create more dynamic web applications.
