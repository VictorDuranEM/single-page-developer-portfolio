## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Links

- Live Site: <https://single-page-design-portfolio-peach.vercel.app/>
- Source Code: <https://github.com/VictorDuranEM/single-page-design-portfolio>

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [CVA](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva) - CSS-in-JS library
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to use CVA to define variants in components that determine the CSS classes to be applied to the components. Also learned how to make a slider similar the one from Netflix.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to include data fetching to learn how to use the getStaticProps and getServerSideProps functions.
